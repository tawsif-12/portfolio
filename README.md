# Portfolio (Vite + React)

A simple React portfolio scaffold.

## Setup (Windows PowerShell)

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
cd e:\test
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Files created
Notes:
 - Place your CV at `e:\test\public\cv.pdf` (or `public/cv.pdf`) so the "Download CV" button works.
 - Replace the placeholder contact info in `src/components/Hero.jsx` with your real email/phone/location.

Feel free to tell me any content, projects, or style preferences to customize further.
